			<p class="intro">Even though this Portuguese island has everything you might want from your holiday destination, it is not as well known
				as it should be. The cliffs, roads, towns and volcanic mountains create the magnificent views that you won’t see anywhere
				else in the world.</p>
			<p><strong> Welcome to Madeira.</strong></p>

					<h3>Cliff Views</h3>
					<p>Why is Madeira so special? First of all, the whole island has been built on <strong>volcanic rocks of the old volcano</strong>.
						That alone gives us beautiful views, the best ones visible from the volcanic cliffs. Since Madeira is located on the
						top of the massive shield volcano, the island is mostly mountainous. This, however, <em>brings the incredible views of the sea, rocky beaches
			and beautiful waves</em>. Be careful though! Since Madeira is actually a really small island with quite high hills and
						mountains, the speed of the wind might be really dangerous for people. But if you take care of yourself and walk around
						the cliffs with caution, the views you will get will blow your mind.</p>

					<h3>Cabo Girão Skywalk</h3>
					<p>Since we have been talking about cliffs, let’s focus a little on <strong>the highest European cliff – <em>Cabo Girão.</em></strong>						With the height of <em>580 metres</em>, it is one of the island’s most beautiful spots. On the top of the cliff, there
						is a skywalk with a glass, transparent floor. This not only leaves you with some extraordinary views of the Madeira
						coast and the Atlantic Ocean but it also really tests your nerves. Standing on the transparent floor over <em>1500 feet</em>						above the sea level might be scary, but we advise to break through your fears and try it out. The feeling you get seeing
						<strong>the views from the Cabo Girão is
			more than amazing.</strong></p>

					<h3>Farmer’s Market</h3>
					<p>If you are a fan of cooking or just food in general, <strong> Funchal’s Mercado dos Lavradores is the place for you.</strong>						This farmer’s market is full of traditionally <em>dressed natives, marvellous fish and, the main attraction, fruit.</em>						The fruit which you can find there is truly a tropical rainbow. From full-flavoured bananas, through papaya and custard
						apples, to an interesting type of fruit called monstera deliciosa. We recommend coming to the farmer’s market with
						a big bag because there is no way you leave that place empty-handed. Foods like these are something every mortal human
						should try. Especially in a place as magnificent as Madeira.</p>

		<h3>Always more to discover.</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Câmara de Lobos.</strong> This picturesque fishing village was a favourite of Sir Winston Churchill, who painted
				here. See the spot where he set up his easel, and relax in characterful cafés that use upturned barrels as tables.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>The Levadas.</strong> Take a walk alongside this network of ancient irrigation channels, built to bring water
				down the mountains to farmland. Still in use, the 1,000 miles of narrow channels are now an UNESCO World Heritage Site.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Sample specialities.</strong> Try filete de espada com banana – battered black swordfish topped with baked banana.
				Enjoy espetada, where skewered chunks of seasoned beef are cooked over hot coals. Lastly, be sure to try poncha, a drink
				made from fermented sugarcane syrup, citrus juice and honey.
